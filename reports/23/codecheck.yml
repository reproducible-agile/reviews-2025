summary: |
  The authors included a DASA section where they briefly but accurately describe key details of the datasets used, software version and scripts generated, and how to access these resources.
  While the link to the code and data repository was anonymized, the author provided the DOI to the data/code repository for reproduction which will be included in the final version of the paper: https://doi.org/10.48436/0cffc-hax39.
  Tables 1-3 and Figures 1-5 were eligible for reproduction.
  All of them were successfully reproduced.
  In general, the paper is fully reproducible because I was able to verify the claims and results presented in the article by re-executing the scripts provided with the accompanying datasets.
