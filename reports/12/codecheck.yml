summary: |
  The paper comes with a GitHub repository that includes all code to reproduce the figures in the paper from the raw data.
  However, part of the data can not be shared.
  While they are available via an API, the time to collect the data is not feasible within the reproducibility review.
  Using only the available data, the corresponding figures could be successfully reproduced after minor code fixes done upon request.
  Overall, the paper is partly reproducible.
