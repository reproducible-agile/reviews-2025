summary: |
  The authors included a DASA section on the paper with an anonymous GitHub link to the repository with the code for the reproduction.
  After initial contact with the authors, the unanonymized link to the GitHub repository was obtained and forked into the reproducible AGILE organization.
  The repository prepared by the authors has clear instructions on reproducibility for the Jupyter notebooks and points to the included QGIS project to recreate Figures 2-4. Figure 5 is the result of one of the notebooks (lcz_analysis.pynb).
  Initially, the code limited the AOI to a subset for testing purposes. This was not initially clear from the documentation, but contacting the authors clarified the discrepancies.
  For this report, the code was successfully run for the whole AOI.
  Figures 2 to 5 could also be successfully reproduced besides manual edits in Figure 5.
