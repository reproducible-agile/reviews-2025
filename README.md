## Contents/Usage

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/reproducible-agile/reviews-2023/HEAD)

To work on the main R Markdown file, `agile-reproducibility-reviews.Rmd`, which includes _all_ information and documentation of the reproducibility review, run (requires GNU Make, and `virtualenv` for Python)

### 1. Start the container with AGILE Reproducibility Reviews Customization

```bash
make
```
The `Makefile`'s default target will create a virtual Python environment to execute [`repo2docker`](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/) using the files in this repository, notably `install.R` where you must add required R packages, and the `Dockerfile` where all system dependencies and remaining software is installed and configured.

### 2. Start RStudio

Then open the Jupyter UI at the link shown in the console.
In the UI, go to "New" > "RStudio" to get an integrated development environment with the required dependencies.

### 3. Prepare your report 

You can copy and paste [report-template/reproreview-template.Rmd](report-template/reproreview-template.Rmd)

```bash
cp report-template/reproreview-template.Rmd reports/[my_report].Rmd
```

### 4. Build your PDF

On RStudio, click `knit` or tick the `Knit on save` button.
